# Output Variables
# The Python print statement is often used to output variables.

# To combine both text and a variable, Python uses the + character:

# Example
x = "awesome"
print("Python is " + x)

# You can also use the + character to add a variable to another variable:

# Example
x = "Python is "
y = "awesome"
z = x + y
print(z)

# For numbers, the + character works as a mathematical operator:

# Example
x = 5
y = 10
print(x + y)
